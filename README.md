This mod is supposed to allow for sync of battles with NPCs as well as Story line mission sync. 

The mod is still a work in progress and is still not completed and might not be completed anytime soon. The mod is not affiliated with HogWarp. 
Current issue is tracking of NPCs. There is currently no way I could find to track NPCs in the game ot sync their damage and location to all players. 
This will need to be addressed before the mod will work.
